# OOP - Object Oriented Programming

OOP is about creating objects that contain both data and methods. 

> The goal of OOP is to simulate the real world objects (for example: Fruits, cars..)

## Why use OOP?
* OOP is faster and easier to execute
* OOP provides a clear structure for the program
* OOP helps with - "DRP" (Don't repeat yourself). 

### Class 
We use class to create a template for objects. 
An `object` is an instance of the class. 
When `Object` is created, it inherits all the varialbes and methods of the class.
